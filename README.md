# New-Vs-Old-Porfolio
This is a recent portfolio:  https://anjeh24.github.io/New-Vs-Old-Porfolio/ which was creating using html and css. The goal was to get better at using cards, positioning them properly in a container with no overflow because I know it was a segment I striggled with a little when I just started learning to code.
